# HeartDisease-Prediction - E2E Deployment using FastAPI and Heroku

## D20018 - DEMD End Term Assignment

## Problem Statement:

To build a classification model that predicts heart disease in paitents. We have to note that 'TenYearCHD' attribute in our dataset is our target variable where we will be predicting.

## Data Source:

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/amanajmera1/framingham-heart-study-dataset

The dataset is publically available on the Kaggle website, and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Variables Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral and medical risk factors.
